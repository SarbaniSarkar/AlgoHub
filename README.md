# Algo Hub

Welcome to Algo Hub! I built this application because I was fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. You can access it here (use Google Chrome!): https://stalwart-sprinkles-833524.netlify.app/

## Meet the Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms: 

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

**A* Search** (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Greedy Best-first Search** (weighted): a faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path

**Swarm Algorithm** (weighted): a mixture of Dijkstra's Algorithm and A*; does not guarantee the shortest-path

**Convergent Swarm Algorithm** (weighted): the faster, more heuristic-heavy version of Swarm; does not guarantee the shortest path

**Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm** (weighted): Swarm from both sides; does not guarantee the shortest path

**Breath-first Search** (unweighted): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path

**Depth-first Search** (unweighted): a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path

On top of the pathfinding algorithms listed above, I implemented a **Recursive Division** Maze Generation algorithm.

## More about the Swarm Algorithm

The Swarm Algorithm is an algorithm that I - at least presumably so (I was unable to find anything close to it online) - co-developed with a good friend Sarbani.  Swarm Algorithm. We named the algorithm "Swarm" because one of its potential applications could be seen in a video-game where a character must keep track of a boss with high priority (the target node), all the while keeping tracking of neighboring enemies that might be swarming nearby.
